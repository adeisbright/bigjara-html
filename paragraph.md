# PARAGRAPH 
A paragraph is a distinct section within a document covering one topic.
It must start on a new line, and can contain more than one sentence.
Paragraphs can be indented for visual appeal or left unattended to.
The paragraph element is used for creating paragraphs in HTML.
The character that represents this element is: “p” 
To create a paragraph, use the general format below: 
<p> Your content </p>
Let us use the example below to demonstrate working with paragraphs.
