# IMAGES 
An image is worth a thousand words.
Within our web page, we will find the need to insert image(s) to convey information.
Images can help to improve the appearance of a web page. 
The <img> tag is used to add an image to a web page. 
The img tag is an empty tag. It contains attributes needed to add an image so do not need a closing tag.
It (img) does not wrap wrap content
We can insert an image into our web page using the image element. The general format for inserting an image is as given below:
<img src=” location-of-image” alt=” descriptive-text-if-image-does-not-load” title=” title-of-the-image” width=”x” height=” y” class=”img-100” id=”image1”>

An image is a void element meaning it has only the opening tag. Everything needed to insert an image is contained within the opening tag.
To add an image to a web document, the following attributes are helpful:
src: This point to where the image is located whether on disk or on a remote system.
It specifies the path to an image.
If the image is not on the same server as the origin server please use an absolute url
alt (“Alternative Text” ) : Its value is a description of the image in certain conditions where it takes longer for the image to display or the image cannot be displayed.It is helpful 
 in letting the user know what infographics is being displayed. It is a mandatory attribute for an image
title: The title of an image will be shown as a tooltip when you hover on the image
It is important in Search Engine Optimization (SEO) 
Class and ID attribute acts the same way for other HTML elements. A class helps in grouping of elements especially for styling purpose.
An ID is used for uniquely selecting an element (node) within JavaScript 
width: Defines the width of an image (optional) 
height: Defines the Height of an image (optional)

Style : You can use the style attribute to provide sytles such as height and width for the image

Warning! Most images on the web are copywrighted. Do not add an image to your page except you own the image ,
have received written permission from the legal owners , or have proof that the image is a free image in the interest
